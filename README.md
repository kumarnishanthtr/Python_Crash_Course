# Python_Crash_Course
My Python Playground: A solo journey through 'Python Crash Course' by Eric Matthes. Each file is a chapter conquered, a step in my coding evolution. No frills, just me, the code, and the quest to master Python.

## Table of Contents
- [Chapter 1: Getting Started](#chapter-1-getting-started)
- [Chapter 1: Variables and Simple Data Types](#chapter-2-variables-and-simple-data-types)


## Chapter 1: Getting Started
In this chapter we found out about the different versions of Python available. And helpful guides on downloading and installing Python for Windows/Linux and Mac OS. We also learnt how to write a simple program to display a print statement. 

### Key Concepts
- **Python versions:** Currently, there are two types of Python available to download. Python2 and Python3

### Code Snippets
```python
# Simple program to display a message using print statement
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Chapter 2: Variables and Simple Data Types
Variable holds a value. Python keeps track of its current value. Variables cannot start with a number ex: `1_variable`, Variables cannot have spaces ex: `my message`. Avoid using function names as variables ex: `print`. Variable names should be short and description. ex: `name_length` and not `n_l` or `length_of_the_name`. 

### Key Concepts
- **NameError:** means we either forgot to set a variable’s value before using it, or we made a spelling mistake when entering the variable’s name.
- **Strings:** Anything inside a single/double quote is a string. These are a type of datatype which is used to store a series of characters.
- **Methods:** A method is an action that Python can perform on a piece of data.

### Code Snippets
```python
# Computers are strict, but they disregard good and bad spelling.
mesage = "Hello Python Crash Course reader!"
print(mesage)

# methods for string
name = "Ada Lovelace"
print(name.upper())
print(name.lower())
```
